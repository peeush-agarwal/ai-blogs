# Portfolio and blogs

This repo is used to maintain [AI-Blogs](https://peeush-agarwal.github.io/ai-blogs/) static website to showcase my blogs and projects related to:

+ Deep learning
+ Computer vision

## Theme

I'm using Jekyll and Github pages to build and maintain the website. Thanks to [Simon Freytag](http://www.freytag.org.uk) who've written wonderful and easy to use Bootstrap 4 Theme. [Link](https://sfreytag.github.io/friday-theme/)

The repo is free to use, but if you do use it, it would be great to hear from you. [Email me](mailto:agarwal.peeush@gmail.com) - thanks!
