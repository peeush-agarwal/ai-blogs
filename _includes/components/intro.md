I'm a .NET Software Developer in EuroForm A/S and have been involved in projects based on

+ ASP.NET Web Forms
+ ASP.NET Web API
+ ASP.NET MVC
+ WPF
+ _others, like basic web tech (Html, Css, Js), Sql server, etc._

Recently, I've gain interest in learning, reading, practicing about _Deep Learning_, _Computer Vision_ and hence, this website to share what I learnt and worked on.

I've taken couple of online courses to gain knowledge and grasp concepts about _Deep Learning_, _Computer Vision_ and what I've learnt from them helps me in the thought process about a problem statement on table.

The goal for this website is to write blogs and share projects with others who are interested in this field.
